## User Stories

### Manage 
As the owner of the contract, I want to be able to manage the contract and kill further changes if necessary.
 1. Deploy the contract and you are automatically assigned as the manager
 2. In the event of a discovered vulnerability or safety implication, call `toggleContractActive` to pause rentals, returns, and new cars being added to the contract

### List Car for Rent
As a car owner, I want to be able to list a car for rent to be rented and declare it is available for rent once a user returns the car.
 1. Complete the fields within the UI
 2. Click the 'Add Car' button to add to the contract
 3. The newly added car listing will appear and be available

### Rent A Car
As a user, I want to be able to see which cars are listed and rent an available one. 
 1. Find a car that is listed as available
 2. Press the rent button
 3. The Car will no longer be available for rent and you will be marked as the current renter of the car

### Return A Car
 1. Ensure you are the owner of the car by checking the car information
 2. Once the car has been returned safely to you from renter, press the return button
 3. The car will be available once again for rent
